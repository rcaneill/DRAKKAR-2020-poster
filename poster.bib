	abstract = {Oceanic fronts shape marine ecosystems; therefore front mapping and characterization are among the most important aspects of physical oceanography. Here we report on the ﬁrst global remote sensing survey of fronts in the Large Marine Ecosystems (LME). This survey is based on a unique frontal data archive assembled at the University of Rhode Island. Thermal fronts were automatically derived with the edge detection algorithm of Cayula and Cornillon (1992, 1995, 1996) from 12 years of twice-daily, global, 9km resolution satellite sea surface temperature (SST) ﬁelds to produce synoptic (nearly instantaneous) frontal maps, and to compute the long-term mean frequency of occurrence of SST fronts and their gradients. These synoptic and long-term maps were used to identify major quasi-stationary fronts and to derive provisional frontal distribution maps for all LMEs. Since SST fronts are typically collocated with fronts in other water properties such as salinity, density and chlorophyll, digital frontal paths from SST frontal maps can be used in studies of physical–biological correlations at fronts. Frontal patterns in several exemplary LMEs are described and compared, including those for: the East and West Bering Sea LMEs, Sea of Okhotsk LME, East China Sea LME, Yellow Sea LME, North Sea LME, East and West Greenland Shelf LMEs, Newfoundland–Labrador Shelf LME, Northeast and Southeast US Continental Shelf LMEs, Gulf of Mexico LME, and Patagonian Shelf LME. Seasonal evolution of frontal patterns in major upwelling zones reveals an order-of-magnitude growth of frontal scales from summer to winter. A classiﬁcation of LMEs with regard to the origin and physics of their respective dominant fronts is presented. The proposed classiﬁcation lends itself to comparative studies of frontal ecosystems.},

Here the contribution of cabbeling and thermobaricity to water mass transformation is calculated in a Neutral Density framework, using temperature gradients derived from observationally based gridded climatologies and observationally based estimates of the spatially varying eddy diﬀusivities. It is shown that cabbeling and thermobaricity play a signiﬁcant role in the water mass transformation budget, with cabbeling having a particularly important role in the formation of Antarctic Intermediate Water and Antarctic Bottom Water. A physical hypothesis is presented which explains why cabbeling is important for Antarctic Intermediate Water formation.

It is shown that the interior buoyancy sink can be determined from surface buoyancy ﬂuxes. These surface buoyancy ﬂuxes are calculated using two surface heat ﬂux climatologies, one based on in situ measurements and the other on a reanalysis, in both cases using a nonlinear equation of state. It is also found that the buoyancy budget in the ocean general circulation model Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean (NEMO) is in good agreement with the buoyancy budgets based on the heat ﬂux climatologies. Moreover, an examination of the vertically resolved buoyancy budget in NEMO shows that in large parts of the ocean the nonlinear buoyancy sink gives the largest contribution to this budget.},

	abstract = {Recent work on the global overturning circulation and its energetics assumes that processes caused by nonlinearities of the equation of state of seawater are negligible. Nonlinear processes such as cabbeling and thermobaricity cause diapycnal motion as a consequence of isopycnal mixing. The nonlinear equation of state also causes the helical nature of neutral trajectories; as a consequence of this helical nature, it is not possible to deﬁne a continuous ‘‘density’’ surface that aligns with neutral tangent planes. The result is an additional diapycnal advection, which needs to be accounted for in water-mass analysis. In this paper, the authors take advantage of new techniques in constructing very accurate continuous density surfaces to more precisely estimate isopycnal and diapycnal processes caused by the nonlinear equation of state. They then quantify the diapycnal advection due to each of these nonlinear processes and show that they lead in total to a signiﬁcant downward diapycnal advection, particularly in the Southern Ocean. The nonlinear processes are therefore another source of dense water formation in addition to high-latitude convection. To maintain the abyssal stratiﬁcation in the global ocean, these dense water masses have to be brought back toward surface layers, and this can occur by either diabatic or adiabatic processes. Including these nonlinear processes into the advection–diffusion balance, the authors show that observed diapycnal diffusivities are unlikely to be able to support the amount of dense water produced in the global ocean, thus placing more importance on the adiabatic way of bringing the deep waters back to the surface.},

	abstract = {Potential temperature is used in oceanography as though it is a conservative variable like salinity; however, turbulent mixing processes conserve enthalpy and usually destroy potential temperature. This negative production of potential temperature is similar in magnitude to the well-known production of entropy that always occurs during mixing processes. Here it is shown that potential enthalpy—the enthalpy that a water parcel would have if raised adiabatically and without exchange of salt to the sea surface—is more conservative than potential temperature by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, it is shown that a ﬂux of potential enthalpy can be called ‘‘the heat ﬂux’’ even though potential enthalpy is undeﬁned up to a linear function of salinity. The exchange of heat across the sea surface is identically the ﬂux of potential enthalpy. This same ﬂux is not proportional to the ﬂux of potential temperature because of variations in heat capacity of up to 5\%. The geothermal heat ﬂux across the ocean ﬂoor is also approximately the ﬂux of potential enthalpy with an error of no more that 0.15\%. These results prove that potential enthalpy is the quantity whose advection and diffusion is equivalent to advection and diffusion of ‘‘heat’’ in the ocean. That is, it is proven that to very high accuracy, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics in the ocean is the conservation equation of potential enthalpy. It is shown that potential enthalpy is to be preferred over the Bernoulli function. A new temperature variable called ‘‘conservative temperature’’ is advanced that is simply proportional to potential enthalpy. It is shown that present ocean models contain typical errors of 0.1ЊC and maximum errors of 1.4ЊC in their temperature because of the neglect of the nonconservative production of potential temperature. The meridional ﬂux of heat through oceanic sections found using this conservative approach is different by up to 0.4\% from that calculated by the approach used in present ocean models in which the nonconservative nature of potential temperature is ignored and the speciﬁc heat at the sea surface is assumed to be constant. An alternative approach that has been recommended and is often used with observed section data, namely, calculating the meridional heat ﬂux using the speciﬁc heat (at zero pressure) and potential temperature, rests on an incorrect theoretical foundation, and this estimate of heat ﬂux is actually less accurate than simply using the ﬂux of potential temperature with a constant heat capacity.},

	abstract = {The thermohaline structure of the Southern Ocean is deeply inﬂuenced by the presence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), where water masses of the World Ocean are advected, transformed, and redistributed to the other basins. It remains a challenge to describe and visualize the complex 3D pattern of this circulation and its associated tracer distribution. Here, a simple framework is presented to analyze the Southern Ocean thermohaline structure. A functional principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to temperature u and salinity S proﬁles to determine the main spatial patterns of their variations. Using the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE), this study determines the vertical modes describing the Southern Ocean thermohaline structure between 5 and 2000 m. The ﬁrst two modes explain 92\% of the combined u–S variance, thus providing a surprisingly good approximation of the thermohaline properties in the Southern Ocean. The ﬁrst mode (72\% of total variance) accurately describes the north–south property gradients. The second mode (20\%) mostly describes salinity at 500 m in the region of Antarctic Intermediate Water formation. These two modes present circumpolar patterns that can be closely related with standard frontal deﬁnitions. By projecting any given hydrographic proﬁle onto the SOSE-based modes, it is possible to determine its position relative to the fronts. The projection is successfully applied on the hydrographic proﬁles of the WOCE SR3 section. The Southern Ocean thermohaline decomposition provides an objective way to deﬁne water mass boundaries and their spatial variability and has useful application for comparing model output with observations.},

We deﬁne the PF as the northernmost minimum of temperature at the subsurface and represent it as a linear combination of the ﬁrst three modes. This method is applied on an ocean reanalysis data set and on in situ observations, revealing a seasonal variability of the PF latitudinal position that is most pronounced between the Conrad Rise and the Kerguelen Plateau. This shift coincides with variations in the transport across the Northern Kerguelen Plateau. We suggest that seasonal changes of the upper stratiﬁcation may drive the observed variability of the PF, with potentially large implications for the pathways and residence time of water masses over the plateau and the phytoplankton bloom extending southeast of the Kerguelen Islands.},

This is partly because of the complicated formulation of the seawater equation of state making it difﬁcult to handle in theoretical studies. In this paper, a hierarchy of polynomial equations of state of increasing complexity, optimal in a least squares sense, is presented. These different simpliﬁed equations of state are then used to simulate the ocean circulation in a global 28-resolution conﬁguration. Comparisons between simulated ocean circulations conﬁrm that nonlinear effects are of major importance, in particular inﬂuencing the circulation through determination of the static stability below the mixed layer, thus controlling rates of exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean interior. It is found that a simple polynomial equation of state, with a quadratic term in temperature (for cabbeling), a temperature–pressure product term (for thermobaricity), and a linear term in salinity, that is, only four tuning parameters, is enough to simulate a reasonably realistic global circulation. The best simulation is obtained when the simpliﬁed equation of state is forced to have an accurate thermal expansion coefﬁcient near the freezing point, highlighting the importance of polar regions for the global stratiﬁcation. It is argued that this simpliﬁed equation of state will be of great value for theoretical studies and pedagogical purposes.},

	abstract = {The Stommel box model elegantly demonstrates that the oceanic response to mixed boundary conditions, combining a temperature relaxation with a ﬁxed salt ﬂux forcing, is non-linear owing to the so-called salt advection feedback. This non-linearity produces a parameter range of bi-stability associated with hysteresis effects characterised by a fast thermally driven mode and a slow salinity-driven mode. Here, we investigate whether a similar dynamical behaviour can be found in the thermohaline loop model, a one-dimensional analogue of the box model. A semi-analytical method to compute possible steady states of the loop model is presented, followed by a linear stability analysis carried out for a large range of loop conﬁgurations. While the salt advection feedback is found as in the box model, a major difference is obtained for the fast mode: an oscillatory instability is observed near the turning point of the fast mode branch, such that the range of bi-stability is systematically reduced, or even removed, in some cases. The oscillatory instability originates from a salinity anomaly that grows exponentially as it turns around the loop, a situation that may occur only when the salinity torque is directed against the loop ﬂow. Factors such as mixing intensity, the relative strength of thermal and haline forcings, the non-linearity of the equation of state or the loop geometry can strongly affect the stability properties of the loop.},

	abstract = {The surface mixed layer (ML) governs atmosphere–ocean ﬂuxes, and thereby affects Earth’s climate. Accurate representation of ML processes in ocean models remains a challenge, however. The O(100) m deep ML exhibits substantial horizontal thermohaline gradients, despite being near-homogenous vertically, making it an ideal location for processes that result from the nonlinearity of the equation of state, such as cabbeling and thermobaricity. Traditional approaches to investigate these processes focus on their roles in interior water-mass transformation and are ill suited to examine their inﬂuence on the ML. However, given the climatic signiﬁcance of the ML, quantifying the extent to which cabbeling and thermobaricity inﬂuence the ML density ﬁeld offers insight into improving ML representations in ocean models. A recent simpliﬁed equation of state of seawater allows the local effects of cabbeling and thermobaric processes in the ML to be expressed analytically as functions of the local temperature gradient and ML depth. These simpliﬁed expressions are used to estimate the extent to which cabbeling and thermobaricity contribute to local ML density differences. These estimates compare well with values calculated directly using the complete nonlinear equation of state. Cabbeling and thermobaricity predominantly inﬂuence the ML density ﬁeld poleward of 308. Mixed layer thermobaricity is basin-scale and winter intensiﬁed, while ML cabbeling is perennial and localized to intense, zonally coherent regions associated with strong temperature fronts, such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream Extensions. For latitudes between 408 and 508 in both hemispheres, the zonally averaged effects of ML cabbeling and ML thermobaricity can contribute on the order of 10\% of the local ML density difference.},

	abstract = {A simple analytical model is used to elucidate a potential mechanism for steady-state mode water formation at a thermohaline front that involves frontogenesis, submesoscale lateral mixing, and cabbeling. This mechanism is motivated in part by recent observations of an extremely sharp, density-compensated front at the North Wall of the Gulf Stream. Here, the intergyre, along-isopycnal, salinity–temperature difference is compressed into a span of a few kilometers, making the ﬂow susceptible to cabbeling. The sharpness of the front is caused by frontogenetic strain, which is presumably balanced by submesoscale lateral mixing processes. The balance is studied with the simple model, and a scaling is derived for the amount of water mass transformation resulting from the ensuing cabbeling. The transformation scales with the strain rate, equilibrated width of the front, and the square of the isopycnal temperature contrast across the front. At the major ocean fronts where mode waters are found, this isopycnal temperature contrast decreases with increasing density near the isopycnal layers where mode waters reside. This implies that cabbeling should result in a convergent diapycnal mass ﬂux into mode water density classes. The scaling for the transformation suggests that at these fronts the process could generate 0.01–1 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv [ 106 m3 s21) of mode water. These formation rates, while smaller than mode water formation by air–sea ﬂuxes, should be independent of season and thus could ﬁll select isopycnal layers continuously and play an important role in the dynamics of mode waters on interannual time scales.},

The conserved energy consists of the kinetic energy plus the Boussinesq dynamic enthalpy hz, which is the integral of the buoyancy with respect to geopotential height Z at a ﬁxed conservative temperature and salinity. In the Boussinesq approximation, the full speciﬁc enthalpy h is the sum of four terms: McDougall’s potential enthalpy, minus the geopotential g0Z, plus the Boussinesq dynamic enthalpy hz, and plus the dynamic pressure. The seawater Boussinesq approximation removes the large and dynamically inert contributions to h, and it reveals the important conversions between kinetic energy and hz.},

	abstract = {The large-scale impacts of sub-mesoscale physics are addressed by comparing mean characteristics of basin-scale, seasonally varying, subtropical and subpolar gyres in a suite of numerical experiments varying in horizontal resolution (1°, 1/9° and 1/54°) and accordingly, in sub-grid scale mixing. After 100 years of simulation, and as suggested from earlier studies, the mean circulation and the mean structure of the ventilated thermocline strongly differ when switching from 1° to 1/9° resolution. Our results emphasize that increasing the resolution from 1/9° to 1/54° leads to major further changes. These changes ensue from the emergence of a denser and more energetic vortex population at 1/54°, occupying most of the basin and sustained by sub-mesoscale physics. Non-linear effects of this turbulence strongly intensify the jet that separates the two gyres, thus steepening the isopycnals and counter-balancing the strong eddy-driven heat transport that tends to ﬂatten them. The jet is more zonal, penetrates further to the east, and is shifted southward by a few degrees, which signiﬁcantly alters the shape and position of the gyres. The strengthening of the main jet comes together with the emergence of a regime of energetic secondary zonal jets, associated with complex recirculations. In parallel, sub-mesoscales restratify both the seasonal and the main thermocline, inducing in particular a reduction of deep convection and the modiﬁcation of the water masses involved in the meridional overturing circulation. Although the results presented here are presumably highly constrained by the idealized geometry of our basin, they suggest that sub-mesoscale processes play an important role on the mean circulation and mean transports at the scale of oceanic basins. At the highest resolution presented here (1/54°), momentum effects are becoming important so that eddies do not simply cause the slumping of isopycnals but can arrange the ﬂow to form jet-like structures with steeper isopycnals in places.},

	abstract = {The abyssal ocean is primarily ﬁlled by cold, dense waters formed around Antarctica and collectively referred to as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). At steady state, AABW must be consumed in the ocean interior at the same rate it is produced, but how and where this consumption is achieved remains poorly understood. Here, estimates of abyssal water mass transformation by geothermal heating and parameterized internal wave–driven mixing are presented. This study uses maps of the energy input to internal waves by tidal and geostrophic motions interacting with topography combined with assumptions about the distribution of energy dissipation to evaluate dianeutral transports induced by breaking internal tides and lee waves. Geothermal transformation is assessed based on a map of geothermal heat ﬂuxes. Under the hypotheses underlying the constructed climatologies of buoyancy ﬂuxes, the authors calculate that locally dissipating internal tides and geothermal heating contribute, respectively, about 8 and 5 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv [ 106 m3 s21) of AABW consumption (upwelling), mostly north of 308S. In contrast, parameterized lee wave–driven mixing causes signiﬁcant transformation only in the Southern Ocean, where it forms about 3 Sv of AABW, decreasing the mean density but enhancing the northward ﬂow of abyssal waters. The possible role of remotely dissipating internal tides in complementing AABW consumption is explored based on idealized distributions of mixing energy. Depending mostly on the chosen vertical structure, such mixing could drive 1 to 28 Sv of additional AABW upwelling, highlighting the need to better constrain the spatial distribution of remote dissipation. Though they carry large uncertainties, these climatological transformation estimates shed light on the qualitative functioning and key unknowns of the diabatic overturning.},

Here an observationally constrained ocean model and an observation-based seasonal climatology are analyzed from a thermodynamic perspective, to assess the diabatic processes controlling overturning in the Southern Ocean. This reveals a seasonal two-stage cold transit in the formation of intermediate water from upwelled deep water. First, relatively warm and saline deep water is transformed into colder and fresher near-surface winter water via wintertime mixing. Second, winter water warms to form intermediate water through summertime surface heat ﬂuxes.

	abstract = {The speciﬁc Gibbs energy of seawater is determined from experimental data of heat capacities, freezing points, vapour pressures and mixing heats at atmospheric pressure in the range À6 to 80 1C in temperature and 0–120 g kg–1 in absolute salinity. Combined with the pure-water properties available from the 1996 Release of the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS-95), and the densities from the 2003 Gibbs function of seawater, a new saline part of the Gibbs function is developed for seawater that has an extended range of validity including elevated temperatures and salinities. In conjunction with the IAPWS 2006 Release on ice, the correct description of concentrated brines by the new formulations permits an accurate evaluation of sea ice properties down to salinity saturation temperatures. The new Gibbs function is expressed in terms of the temperature scale ITS-90. Its input variable for the concentration is absolute salinity, available from the new Reference-Composition Salinity Scale of 2008.},

	abstract = {The problem of ﬁnding the state of minimum potential energy through the rearrangement of water parcels with a nonlinear equation of state is discussed in the context of a combinatorial optimization problem. It is found that the problem is identical to a classical optimization problem called the linear assignment problem. This problem belongs to a problem class known as P, a class of problems that have known efﬁcient solutions. This is very fortunate since this study’s problem has been suggested to be an asymmetric traveling salesman problem. A problem that belongs to a class called NP-hard, for which no efﬁcient solutions are known. The difference between the linear assignment problem and the traveling salesman problem is discussed and made clear by looking at the different constraints used for the two problems. It is also shown how the rearrangement of water parcels that minimizes the potential energy can be found in polynomial time using the so-called Hungarian algorithm. The Hungarian algorithm is then applied to a simpliﬁed ocean stratiﬁcation, and the result is compared to a few different approximate solutions to the minimization problem. It is found that the improved accuracy over the approximate methods comes at a high computational cost. Last, the algorithm is applied to a realistic ocean stratiﬁcation using a technique that splits the minimization problem into smaller bits.},

	abstract = {Determining the role of Southern Ocean warm intermediate water for driving melting of the Antarctic ice sheet is a major challenge in assessing future sea level rise. Analysis of 2859 CTD proﬁles obtained between 1977 and 2016 by ships and instrumented seals at the Weddell Sea continental slope reveals a seasonal rise of the Antarctic Slope Front thermocline by more than 100 m during the summer. The signal at Kapp Norvegia (178W) corresponds with a seasonal warming downstream at the Filchner Trough (408W), indicating that a coherent evolution of the slope front along the shelf break regulates the onshore ﬂow of warm deep water. Climatological cross sections of the slope front hydrography show that downwelling of Antarctic Surface Water forms a secondary front above the warm deep water interface during summer. Enhanced baroclinic growth rates at this front suggest that the wind-driven suppression of the thermocline is partially compensated by a shallower eddy overturning cell when surface water is present. A simple model of the Weddell Gyre boundary current reveals that wintertime densiﬁcation of surface waters is crucial for maintaining the deep thermocline along the eastern Weddell Sea coast. The sensitivity of the warm inﬂow to the cross-frontal density gradient implies a positive feedback with ice shelf melting that may lead to an abrupt transition into a high melting state once warm water rises over the shelf break depth. Despite its regional focus, this study highlights the role of upper ocean buoyancy ﬂuxes for controlling the thermocline depth along seasonally ice-covered narrow shelf regions with cyclonic along-slope winds.},

	abstract = {A subpolar marginal sea, like the Nordic seas, is a transition zone between the temperature-stratiﬁed subtropics (the alpha ocean) and the salinity-stratiﬁed polar regions (the beta ocean). An inﬂow of Atlantic Water circulates these seas as a boundary current that is cooled and freshened downstream, eventually to outﬂow as Deep and Polar Water. Stratiﬁcation in the boundary region is dominated by a thermocline over the continental slope and a halocline over the continental shelves, separating Atlantic Water from Deep and Polar Water, respectively. A conceptual model is introduced for the circulation and water mass transformation in a subpolar marginal sea to explore the potential interaction between the alpha and beta oceans. Freshwater input into the shelf regions has a slight strengthening effect on the Atlantic inﬂow, but more prominently impacts the water mass composition of the outﬂow. This impact of freshwater, characterized by enhancing Polar Water outﬂow and suppressing Deep Water outﬂow, is strongly determined by the source location of freshwater. Concretely, perturbations in upstream freshwater sources, like the Baltic freshwater outﬂow into the Nordic seas, have an order of magnitude larger potential to impact water mass transports than perturbations in downstream sources like the Arctic freshwater outﬂow. These boundary current dynamics are directly related to the qualitative stratiﬁcation in transition zones and illustrate the interaction between the alpha and beta oceans.},

The fact that the vertical coordinate (density) depends on the properties being transported (namely salinity and potential temperature) renders the inclusion of vertical mixing in layered models a subtle problem. The approach the authors have taken is based upon the entrainment into a layer being proportional to the turbulent activity in that layer. Across each interface there are then two entrainment velocities, one upward velocity that is the entrainment of ﬂuid into the layer above the interface, and one downward velocity, being the entrainment velocity into the layer below the interface. This double entrainment accounts for both the diffusive and the advective consequences of turbulent mixing. The proposed scheme works without approximation for a nonlinear equation of state and can readily handle the production of density caused by cabbeling. Several examples are given.},

If such a view is adopted, then the conservation equations for tracers contain errors that are often as large as the diapycnal mixing term. This result has been known for about a decade and, at face value, implies that all Boussinesq ocean models contain leading-order errors in their conservation equations. To date there has not yet been a solution proposed to avoid this conundrum. Here it is shown that the conundrum can be solved by interpreting the horizontal velocity vector carried by Boussinesq ocean models as the average horizontal mass ﬂux per unit area divided by the constant reference density that appears in the horizontal momentum equation. The authors argue that the vector labeled the ‘‘velocity’’ in present ocean models is not, and never was, the Eulerian mean velocity. If it were, then the conservation equations for salinity anomaly and potential temperature would contain systematic errors whose magnitude would be as large as the diapycnal mixing terms. By interpreting the model’s horizontal ‘‘velocity’’ as being proportional to the horizontal mass ﬂux per unit area, the conservation equations in the present generation of Boussinesq models are actually much more accurate even than previously thought. In particular, when these Boussinesq models achieve a steady state, they are actually almost fully non-Boussinesq, and in a nonsteady state there is no systematic error in the diapycnal advective/diffusive balance due to the Boussinesq approximation. With the above interpretation of the model’s ‘‘velocity,’’ it is also relatively simple to change the model code to make it fully non-Boussinesq even when the ﬂow is unsteady.},

Rather, the adiabatic lapse rate is proportional to the thermal expansion coefﬁcient and is independent of the ﬂuid’s compressibility. Here we show that the adiabatic lapse rate is independent of the increase in the internal energy that a parcel experiences when it is compressed. We explain what is missing from the traditional explanation of the adiabatic lapse rate and we explore the thermodynamic cause of the adiabatic lapse rate.

	abstract = {In studies of ocean mixing, it is generally assumed that small-scale turbulent overturns lose 15\%–20\% of their energy in eroding the background stratiﬁcation. Accumulating evidence that this energy fraction, or mixing efﬁciency Rf, signiﬁcantly varies depending on ﬂow properties challenges this assumption, however. Here, the authors examine the implications of a varying mixing efﬁciency for ocean energetics and deep-water mass transformation. Combining current parameterizations of internal wave-driven mixing with a recent model expressing Rf as a function of a turbulence intensity parameter Reb 5 «n /nN2, the ratio of dissipation «n to stratiﬁcation N2 and molecular viscosity n, it is shown that accounting for reduced mixing efﬁciencies in regions of weak stratiﬁcation or energetic turbulence (high Reb) strongly limits the ability of breaking internal waves to supply oceanic potential energy and drive abyssal upwelling. Moving from a ﬁxed Rf 5 1/6 to a variable efﬁciency Rf(Reb) causes Antarctic Bottom Water upwelling induced by locally dissipating internal tides and lee waves to fall from 9 to 4 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv [ 106 m3 s21) and the corresponding potential energy source to plunge from 97 to 44 GW. When adding the contribution of remotely dissipating internal tides under idealized distributions of energy dissipation, the total rate of Antarctic Bottom Water upwelling is reduced by about a factor of 2, reaching 5–15 Sv, compared to 10–33 Sv for a ﬁxed efﬁciency. The results suggest that distributed mixing, overﬂow-related boundary processes, and geothermal heating are more effective in consuming abyssal waters than topographically enhanced mixing by breaking internal waves. These calculations also point to the importance of accurately constraining Rf (Reb) and including the effect in ocean models.},

However, it is here shown that because of the nonlinear character of the equation of state (in particular the thermobaric effect) such a neutral displacement is accompanied by a conversion between internal energy E and gravitational potential energy U, and an equal conversion between U and kinetic energy K. While there is thus no net change of U, K does change. This implies that a force is in fact required for the displacement.},

Like this previous result, the present one shows that the dissipation rate vanishes in the limit of vanishing molecular diffusivity of temperature and salinity, if the range of temperatures and salinities occurring in the ﬂuid is regarded as given. A numerical evaluation for realistic ocean parameters shows that the upper bound is two orders of magnitude smaller than present estimates of the energy transformation involved in the deep ocean circulation. This supports the conclusion that mechanical forcing by winds and tides is necessary to sustain the deep ocean circulation.},

	abstract = {The concept of available potential energy is supposed to indicate which part of the potential energy is available to transform into kinetic energy. Yet it is impossible to obtain a unique deﬁnition of available potential energy for the real ocean because of nonlinearities of the equation of state, rendering its usefulness largely hypothetical. In this paper, the conservation of energy is ﬁrst reformulated in terms of horizontal anomalies of density and pressure for a simpliﬁed ocean model using the Boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations. This framework introduces the concept of ‘‘dynamical potential energy,’’ deﬁned as the horizontal anomaly of potential energy, to replace available potential energy. Modiﬁed conservation equations are derived that make it much simpler to identify oceanic power input by buoyancy and mechanical forces. Closed budgets of energy are presented for idealized circulations obtained with a general circulation model, comparing spatial patterns of power inputs generated by wind and thermal forcings. Finally, a generalization of the framework to compressible ﬂuids is presented, opening the way to applications in atmosphere energetics.},

	abstract = {Owing to the larger thermal expansion coefﬁcient at higher temperatures, more buoyancy is put into the ocean by heating than is removed by cooling at low temperatures. The authors show that, even with globally balanced thermal and haline surface forcing at the ocean surface, there is a negative density ﬂux and hence a positive buoyancy ﬂux. As shown by McDougall and Garrett, this must be compensated by interior densiﬁcation on mixing due to the nonlinearity of the equation of state (cabbeling). Three issues that arise from this are addressed: the estimation of the annual input of density forcing, the effects of the seasonal cycle, and the total cabbeling potential of the ocean upon complete mixing. The annual expansion through surface density forcing in a steady-state ocean driven by balanced evaporation–precipitation–runoff (E–P–R) and net radiative budget at the surface Qnet is estimated as 74 000 m3 s21 (0.07 Sv; 1 Sv [ 106 m3 s21), which would be equivalent to a sea level rise of 6.3 mm yr21. This is equivalent to approximately 3 times the estimated rate of sea level rise or 450\% of the average Mississippi River discharge. When seasonal variations are included, this density forcing increases by 35\% relative to the time-mean case to 101 000 m3 s21 (0.1 Sv). Likely bounds are established on these numbers by using different Qnet and E–P–R datasets and the estimates are found to be robust to a factor of ;2. These values compare well with the cabbeling-induced contraction inferred from independent thermal dissipation rate estimates. The potential sea level decrease upon complete vertical mixing of the ocean is estimated as 230 mm. When horizontal mixing is included, the sea level drop is estimated as 300 mm.},
